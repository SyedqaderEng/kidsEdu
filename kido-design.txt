Analysis of Aikido.dev’s Design

I explored the site and these are the major design components, layout patterns, and style characteristics:
1. Global Page Structure / Layout
Header / Navigation Bar
Logo on the left.
Primary navigation links (“Platform”, “Solutions”, “By Use Case”, etc.).
Secondary links: “Pricing”, “Contact”, “Login”, “Start for Free”.
Language selector (“EN FR JP DE PT”) — localized site.
Clean horizontal nav bar, likely sticky or fixed.
Hero / Banner Section (Above the Fold)
Big headline (“Secure everything, Compromise nothing.”) + sub‑headline.
Primary CTA (Call to Action) buttons (e.g., “Start for Free”, “Book a demo”).
Trust / social proof line (“Trusted by 50k+ orgs | Loved by 100k+ devs”)
Images: multiple layered or floating images (or graphics) — they seem to use a grid of “cards” or boxed images (maybe a carousel or static grid).
Features / Solutions Section
A set of cards / tiles listing “By Scanner” (SAST, SCA, Secrets, etc.).
Another set “By Use Case” and “By Feature” and “By Stage / Industry” — organized in a tile or grid layout.
Value Proposition / How It Works Section
Descriptive content about how Aikido contextualizes vulnerabilities, reduces noise, filters false positives.
Likely “feature + image” or “text + image” alignment.
Trust / Compliance Section
Mentions of trust center, SOC 2, ISO 27001 — building credibility.
Likely icons or badges for compliance.
Deep Feature / Behavior Explanation
Auto‑fix, auto-triage, custom rules.
This is often presented with icons + text + maybe flow diagrams or visuals of UI.
Integration Section
Logos of integrations (GitHub, Bitbucket, Jira, VSCode, etc.) — horizontally aligned icons.
Very common for SaaS: show what tools they support.
Testimonials / Customer Stories Section
Real user quotes, names, titles, possibly company logos.
Probably laid out in a carousel or grid.
Footer
Important links: Docs, Trust Center, Integrations, About, Careers, Blog, Pricing, Contact.
Social links: YouTube, LinkedIn, X (Twitter).
Copyright / brand.
Design Style Characteristics
Typography:
The font is very clean, modern sans-serif.
Hierarchy: large headline, smaller sub‑headline, smaller body.
Probably limited font weights for clarity.
Color Palette:
Primarily minimal / neutral (white background, dark text).
Accent colors for buttons or call to action.
Use of subtle colors in icons / graphics.
Imagery & Graphics:
Use of abstract or techy illustrations / images (possibly custom).
Icons for features (SAST, SCA, etc.).
Integration logos are in monochrome or colored, depending.
White Space / Padding:
Generous padding between sections.
Enough whitespace so that each section “breathes.”
Visual Hierarchy:
Hero section is dominant.
Feature tiles are clearly separated.
Integration logos are visually smaller but grouped.
Interactivity:
Buttons with hover states.
The nav likely collapses or changes on mobile.
Possibly scroll-based animations / reveals (hard to tell without dev tools).
Responsiveness:
The layout is likely responsive (since it’s a modern SaaS site).
Component Breakdown (What You Need to Design)
Based on the above, here are all the components / design elements you’d need to build a similar theme:
Header / Nav Component
Logo
Primary nav links (multi-level maybe)
Secondary nav (Pricing / Contact / Login)
CTAs in header (“Start for Free”)
Language selector
Hero / Banner Component
Headline + Subheadline
Call-to-action buttons (primary + secondary)
Trust line (text + optional icons)
Hero illustration / image(s)
Feature / Solution Card Component
Card with title, description, optional icon
Possibly clickable to “Learn more”
Grid layout for multiple cards
Use-Case / Feature / Stage Section
Same as feature cards but categorized by use-case or stage
Tabs or segmented control (if switching between different categories)
Value / Benefit Section
Text block + image / illustration
Alternating layout (image left + text right, then reverse) — common pattern
Badges (SOC 2, ISO, etc.)
Short text explaining compliance
Possibly a “Learn more” linking to Trust Center
Auto‑Fix / Behavior / Workflow Section
Step-by-step component (maybe horizontal or vertical)
Icons for each step: Auto-fix, Triage, Custom Rules
Descriptive text
Integration Logos Section
Grid or row of integration logos
Each logo clickable (maybe)
Consistent sizing, alignment
Testimonials / Customer Stories
Quote + Name + Role + Company Logo
Card or carousel layout
Navigation links (grouped by category)
Social media icons
Secondary links (Privacy, Terms, etc.)
Copyright notice
Global Components / Utilities
Button styles (primary, secondary)
Typography styles (H1, H2, body, small)
Color palette / theme variables
Form components (if needed)
Responsive breakpoints
Icons / icon set
Possibly alert / banner components (for announcements)
Design System / Tools Recommendation
To design a similar theme, you can use:
Figma (or Sketch / Adobe XD) to design all these components as a design system.
Create a component library with:
Buttons
Cards
Icons
Typography Styles
Layout constraints (Auto-Layout in Figma)
Define a spacing scale (e.g., 8px, 16px, 24px, etc.) for consistent padding/margins.
Define color tokens (primary, secondary, background, text, etc.).
Use a UI framework (if building) — e.g., React + Tailwind CSS or Chakra UI or Material UI — to implement these.
Suggested Workflow to Recreate the Theme
Audit the Current Site
Take screenshots of all sections.
Use browser dev tools to inspect spacing, font sizes, and colors.
Note down all the distinct section types.
Wireframe / Layout
Sketch high-level wireframes for each major section: hero, features, integrations, footer, etc.
Define how many cards per row, how sections stack on mobile, etc.
Design in Figma
Build a design system file: typography, colors, grid, spacing.
Design components: cards, buttons, nav, hero, etc.
Assemble the page using the components.
Prototype / Review
Create a clickable prototype to review flows and layout.
Get feedback on spacing, readability, visual balance.
Handoff / Build
Export design tokens to CSS / code (if using something like Tailwind, you can set design tokens in tailwind.config.js).
Build the components in your stack (React, Vue, etc.).
